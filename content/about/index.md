I am a Solutions Architect and Software Engineer who designs and builds complex distributed systems end-to-end. My work sits at the intersection of software architecture, systems engineering, and infrastructure — whether cloud, on-premise, or bare metal.

Over the years, I have architected and hands-on delivered production platforms handling millions of requests, from high-level system design and domain modeling down to writing the services, pipelines, and infrastructure code that bring them to life. I specialize in breaking down complex business problems into clean, scalable architectures — microservices, event-driven systems, API platforms — and then engineering them into production with the same rigor. Every system I build is designed to be resilient, observable, and maintainable at scale.
