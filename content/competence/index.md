## What Makes Me Tick Technically

I'm like a technical Swiss Army knife, but with more cloud diagrams and fewer tiny scissors. Here's what I love working with:

🏗️ **Cloud Architecture:** AWS and Azure are my digital playgrounds. I enjoy architecting everything from simple websites to complex distributed systems. Building efficient cloud solutions that don't make the finance department panic is my idea of fun.

💻 **Language Agnostic Development:** I don't play favorites with programming languages - to me, they're all just different tools for solving interesting problems. I enjoy the challenge of picking up whatever language best fits the task at hand.

🔌 **System Integration:** There's something oddly satisfying about connecting systems that weren't designed to talk to each other. It's like being a technology matchmaker - finding that perfect interface between a legacy system and modern APIs.

🛡️ **Security:** I'm fascinated by building secure systems that remain usable. Finding that balance between Fort Knox-level protection and actual user friendliness is a puzzle I never tire of solving.

These technical interests have taken me through some fascinating challenges over the years, from scaling applications to millions of users to diagnosing why that one Docker container keeps mysteriously crashing every Tuesday.
